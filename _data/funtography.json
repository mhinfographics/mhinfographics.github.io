That's about 11.5 times the size of the land area. <br> While browsing around, I came across <a href='https://serc.carleton.edu/details/images/12596.html' target='_blank'>this map</a> showing tectonic plates and elevation profiles, and I thought it would be fun to make a 'terraced' version... so, here it is.",
