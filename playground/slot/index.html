            Randomness is key in many aspects of our daily lives. <a target="_blank"
                href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/articles/Random_number_generation">Cryptography uses it to generate
                keys</a> that are difficult for humans to crack, encrypting your sensitive data. However, with the increasing power of
            computers and the boom in artificial intelligence, these methods could soon become obsolete. We will need 
            other ways to protect our data due to the growing power of computers and AI...

            But that’s a whole other topic in itself. Let’s stay for now within the wonderful world of randomness.
            So stay with me here, I promise you’ll enjoy it.

        <h3>Nature also plays with randomness and chaos</h3>
        <p class="desc">
            Here’s an <a target="_blank"
                href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/half-life-coins/">article from Scientific American</a> that
            discusses how radioactivity decays randomly and also that over time, the pattern is predictable. With a coin-flips experiment, 
            they explain the parallel of the half-life chance. A fun and safe way for understanding why nuclear contamination 
            fades quickly at first but leaves small, lasting traces for decades that we can predict.
        </p>
        <p class="desc">
            Isn’t that amazingly interesting?
            Even tho that’s an article for kids, it’s quite interesting to read...
        </p>
        <p class="desc">
            Or maybe I just enjoy children’s books too much, which is also a plausible possibility. The point is that randomness 
            is present in many ways in our lives, sometimes even as a kind of chaos, as in video games or table games.
        </p>
        <h3>Slot machines</h3>
        <p class="desc">
            I thought of giving this computer a task, I wrote a little script to make the images below line up, the code
            starts at a “random” position, then moves each line to 12 random positions and repeats the movement until
            all three columns match a picture. It’s kind of satisfying to watch a machine struggle to complete a task, it’s
            also super silly to see that sometimes it just sits there... and moves wrong.
        </p>

            <div id="slot_machines">
                <div class="slot_machine machine_1">
                    <div class="counter">
                        <p>Count: 0</p>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <div class="slot_machine machine_2">
                    <div class="counter">
                        <p>Count: 0</p>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <div class="slot_machine machine_3">
                    <div class="counter">
                        <p>Count: 0</p>
                    </div>
                </div>
            </div>
            <button class="btn_flat" id="reset_btn">Restart spinning</button>
        </div>
        <p class="desc">
            For sure an artificial intelligence bot could do it easily, but my point is that this silly code can show you that sometimes this
            task is solved in a just a few attempts, other times with much more difficulty. I tested this a few
            times and sometimes it gets it with a single spin... I wonder how many spins were for you?
        </p>
        <p class="desc">
            If we go technical, that example is not really random because you can trace back its logic. If you are
            really really unlucky, you will see the spiners do 1.728 attempts to line up the images. Not really attractive
            odds if you are gambling... so why do people go to casinos?
        </p>
        <p class="desc">
            There are many reasons and ways to encourage people to enjoy the thrill of chance, even when the odds aren’t in their favor.
        </p>
        <p class="desc">
            Perhaps, looking at the spinners above, you get the feeling that they will land on the correct combination on the next spin because they seem so close... but they don’t. In fact, if I told you that after running this code several times, I observed it solve itself in just one attempt, that might encourage others to see if it can be solved in a few tries, even though you have no control over it and haven’t placed any bets.
        </p>
        <p class="desc">
            With the example above, you have approximately a 14% chance of getting the correct combination in fewer than 300 attempts, but you also have an 86% chance of not getting it.
        </p>
        <p class="desc">
            That’s how casinos make money; nine out of ten times, the outcome won’t be favorable for those who bet based on that logic. That’s also the art of uncertainty used to clear up your pockets.

        <h3>Here’s a fun thing about this article</h3>

                target="_blank">as most of the English speakers seems to do,</a> it would take you approximately some 3
            minutes to read this article. Once you reach this point, a custom bug is waiting for you.
        </p>
        <p class="desc">
            Since you landed in this page, a script has being running in the background adding a part of the bug every
            ten seconds. The faster you read, the smaller your bug is. The pseudo random part of the script has made
            a weird mix for you, and as <b>its name,</b> it is weird and unique. Beyond the length, there are about
            216 different combinations of head, body, tail and/or color.

        <p class="desc">
            Well, if you know me, you know <a href="https://sundaysketchbook.art/about/" target="_blank">I like
                bugs,</a> I was thinking of a metaphor of a bug, dormant underground, at the bottom of this
            piece waiting for you... creepy yes. It’s my personalized and creepy gift for you. This is the Art of
            Randomness in all its might!
        </p>
        <p class="desc">
            This is also a personal experiment to see how long people stay in a page, I currently don’t have any 
            trackers here to check readers metrics, but if you found the idea interesting, let me know on social
            media how long you stayed here.
        </p>
        <p class="desc">
            Thanks for reading. Reload this page if you’d like to see a different bug or if you have
            better luck with the slot machines above too.<br>
            See you soon with more weird stuff.
