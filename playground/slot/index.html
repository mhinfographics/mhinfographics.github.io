        <h3>The art of uncertainty</h3>
        <p class="desc">
            Randomness is key in many aspects of our daily lives. <a target="_blank"
                href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/articles/Random_number_generation">Cryptography uses "randomness" to
                generate secure keys</a> and guarantee the unpredictability of encrypted data, although with
            increasingly
            powerful computers these methods may soon become obsolete.

            Nature also plays with randomness sometimes. I read <a target="_blank"
                href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/half-life-coins/">at Scientific American</a> that
            radioactivity decays
            randomly, isn’t that amazingly interesting? They say that atoms decay randomly at any given moment in time.
            Even tho that’s an article for kids, it’s quite interesting to read... Or I might enjoy too much kids’
            books, that’s also a
            possibility. The point is randomness is present in many ways in our lives. Or maybe a sort of randomness or
            chaos like in
            games.

            I thought of giving this computer a task, I wrote a little script to make the images below line up, the code
            starts at a "random" position, then moves each line to 12 random positions and repeats the movement until
            all three lines are aligned. It’s kind of satisfying to watch a machine struggle to complete a task, it’s
            also super
            silly to see that sometimes it just sits there... and moves wrong.

            For sure an AI could do it easily, but my point is that this silly code can show you that sometimes this
            task is solved in a just a few attempts, other times with much more difficulty. I ran this script a few
            times and
            the quickest it took was 6 spins. I wonder how many spins were for you?
        </p>
        <p class="desc">
            If we go technical, that example is not really random because you can trace back its logic. If you are
            really really unlucky, you will see the spiners do 1.728 attempts to line up the images. But here’s when
            things get interesting, you might have
            the sense that the spiners would align in the next spin, because they go so close to the right combination,
            but they don’t, that’s why
            people go to try their luck at casinos. With this example, you have about 14% of chance to get the right
            combination in less than 300 attempts, but
            you also have 86% of chance to not get it.
        </p>
        <p class="desc">
            That’s how casinos make money, they have higher chances to win than you do. In this case 9 to 1... That’s
            also the art of uncertainty used to clear up your pockets.

        <h3>Here’s a fun thing about this article</h3>
        <p class="desc">
            If you read at an average speed of 200-250 words per minute, <a
                href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0749596X19300786#:~:text=Based%20on%20the%20analysis%20of,and%20260%20wpm%20for%20fiction"
                target="_blank">as most of the English speakers seems to do,</a> it would take you approximately some 3
            minutes to read this article. Once you reach the end, a custom funny bug is waiting for you, it’s weird and
            unique, and the next person who enters this page would see a different version of it.
        </p>
        <p class="desc">
            Since you landed in this page, a script has being running in the background adding a part of the bug every
            10 seconds. The faster you read, the smaller your bug is. But the pseudo random part of the script has made
            a weird unique mix for you...

        <h3>But why???</h3>
        <p class="desc">
            Well, if you know me, you know <a href="https://sundaysketchbook.art/about/" target="_blank">I like
                bugs,</a> but also I was thinking of a metaphor of a bug, dormant underground, at the bottom of this
                piece waiting for you... creepy yes. It’s my personalized and creepy gift for you. This is the Art of
                Randomness in all its might!

            Thanks for reading, and see you soon with more weird stuff.
