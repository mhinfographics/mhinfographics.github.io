            Randomness is key in many aspects of our daily lives. <a target="_blank"
                href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/articles/Random_number_generation">Cryptography uses 'randomness' to generate
                secure keys</a> and guarantee the unpredictability of encrypted data, although with increasingly
            powerful computers these methods may soon become obsolete.
        </p>

            Randomness is present in nature. <a target="_blank"
                href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/half-life-coins/">This article in Scientific American
                amazed me</a> when I read that radioactivity decays randomly. “At any given moment in time, there is a
            chance that an atom will decay, but there is also a chance it will remain the same.” Even tho that's an
            article for kids, it's quite interesting to read... Or I might enjoy too much kids' books, that's also a
            possibility.
        </p><p class="desc">
            The thing is that randomness is present in many ways in our lives. Or maybe a sort of randomness or chaos like in
            games. I thought of giving this computer a task, I wrote a little script to make the images below line up, the code
            starts at a 'random' position, then moves each line to 12 random positions and repeats the movement until all three
            lines are aligned. It's kind of satisfying to watch a machine struggle to complete a task, it's also super silly to
            see that sometimes it just sits there... and moves wrong.

            For sure an AI could do it easily, but my point is that this silly code can show you that sometimes this task is
            solved in a just a few attempts, other times with much more difficulty, and that's
            fascinating because it gives us the illusion that we can win, but in many cases it's actually a matter
            of things not aligning. I ran this script a few times and the quickest it took was 6 spins. But in the other end, on
            one occasion it took 286 attemps!
        </p>
        <p class="desc">
            However, if we go technical, the code is not really random, it's pseudo-random, you can trace back its logic since I set-up 
            many condictions for it work they way I wanted to. You can reduce the amount of posibilites to 12 combinations per slot per spin, 
            if we add 3 sloths and the 3 "machines" the number of combinations become larger. If you are really really unlucky, you will see
            the spiners do 1.728 attempts to line up the images. But here's when things get interesting, you might have the sense that the spiners 
            would align in the next spin, because they go so close to the right combination, but they don't. You have about 14% of chance to get the
            right combination in less than 300 attemps, but you also have 86% of chance to not get it. That's how casinos make money, they have higher 
            chances to win than you do. In this case 9 to 1...
