                        <h3>How helicopters sketch-out Manhattan</h3>
                        <p class="desc">New York City is always bustling with traffic, it doesn’t matter if you’re
                            talking about
                            its streets or its skies. There are so many daily flights of all kinds of aircraft that you
                            can see
                            the lines they leave behind trace the outline of the Hudson River to the west of Manhattan,
                            or the
                            East River in the other side of the island as well.<br>In the image below, you can see
                            purple dots
                            representing air traffic in Arbil 9, 2025.<br> Observe the straight lines left by airplanes
                            approaching airports and how these lines converge at crossroads as they land or take
                            off.<br>On the
                            other hand, the most organic patterns are created by helicopters flying low over the rivers;
                            there
                            are some loops near the Statue of Liberty, there are even some circles here and there, those
                            are
                            probably police helicopters conducting surveillance or belonging to a TV channel.</p>

                            <p>This phenomenon isn’t unique to this city, but NYC is a place where the intense air
                                traffic
                                creates this distinctive pattern. I live just across the East River in Astoria, some
                                mornings
                                helicopters doing loops have woken me up at 4am, they are like those mosquitoes that
                                buzz around
                                your ears when you are camping outdoors. <br><br>But if you live in NYC, even though
                                helicopters
                                are annoying, you get used to them. Below is a close-up showing traffic over Manhattan
                                and its
                                surroundings in different days of April 2025.</p>

                            <p>As you might noticed, suddenly, one day everything went a little more quiet on the river
                                banks.
                                On April 10, 2025, a Bell 206 helicopter on a sightseeing tour <a target="_blank"
                                    href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/articles/2025_Hudson_River_helicopter_crash">crashed
                                    into
                                    the Hudson River.</a> All six onboard—a family of five Spanish tourist and the
                                pilot—died.
                                The skies were paralyzed for a few days, and just for one moment, the shape of the
                                island was
                                not drawn by aircraft as usual. <br> That event took me to explore these curious
                                patterns in the
                                air traffic. Check below a few maps looking at the skies of those days but only looking
                                at
                                helicopters flying between April 9 - 15.</p>

                            <p>After looking at that sequence, is kind of shocking to see how the skies returned to
                                normal in
                                just a few days. By April 15, the usual patterns were back again, by density of paths,
                                the 14th
                                looks almost with even more activity than the days before the accident. Here’s a larger
                                map of
                                the following day showing all traffic once more with helicopters highlighted in light
                                brown and
                                other aircraft in purple.</p>

                            <p>It’s a very busy city, and the sky is no exception. This is just a curiosity about how
                                air
                                traffic patterns can permanently draw shapes in the sky; it seemed to me that there was
                                a story
                                behind the patterns that could be briefly told. The accident that day was tragic; the
                                city has
                                many regulations for drones and helicopters, but even so, an accident can happen
                                anytime,
                                anywhere. <br><br> –Thanks for reading!</p>
