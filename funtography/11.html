                        <h3>The Cityverse</h3>
                        <p class="desc">Like soap bubbles, the cities we live in are like micro-universes,
                            self-contained units that somehow gather everything they need to function. I love how each
                            of these mini-universes has its own identity. Every place I've been to has something unique,
                            a particular way of doing things so to speak.<br>For this reason, I was thinking about
                            visualizing different cities, some because I have them tattooed on my soul, others because
                            they seem curious to me and they contrast with each other. To do this I have used data from
                            Copernicus <a target="_blank"
                                href="https://human-settlement.emergency.copernicus.eu/download.php?ds=builtH">Global
                                Human Settlement Layer</a> (GHSL) and Sentinel's <a target="_blank"
                                href="https://livingatlas.arcgis.com/landcoverexplorer/#mapCenter=-84.06966%2C9.93036%2C11&amp;mode=step&amp;timeExtent=2017%2C2023&amp;year=2023">Land
                                use classification.</a>Below you can see my hometown in its micro universe.<br>The brown
                            markings are buildings in the central valley. The darker the markings, the taller the
                            buildings according to the GHSL classification.</p>

                            <p>This particular city seems to have a lot of empty space, but the wide mountain ranges on
                                the sides have shaped the city's expansion into this curious pattern, but there are also
                                other things that make it unique, such as the amount of vegetation around it. See what
                                the same place looks like by adding a layer of vegetation from Sentiel land use.</p>

                            <p>Following the same principle, I have applied the same process to create bubbles of a
                                dozen cities. All with their own notable characteristics. Look below and think about the
                                conclusions you can get from these spheres. For example, look at how little green area
                                there is, with a few exceptions. Note that all the spheres you see here are at the
                                <b>same scale of about 80 km<sup>2</sup>,</b> same as the first two you already saw
                                above.<br>Denser cities, with large built-up areas look a bit darker, in some cases the
                                water and bare land make for an interesting contrast... all fun to see.</p>

                            <p>Although it is perhaps a little easier to see the contrast of the extension of the built
                                areas and the heights of those blocks with a version like the first one you saw at the
                                beginning of this post.<br> In my creative processes I always make many versions of the
                                same thing, regardless of whether it is for my work, or as in this case, just for fun.
                                Here they are again in that other format.</p>

                            <p>As I said above, some of these places are quite special for me. I spend many years living
                                in Hong Kong, the geography of the place is super interesting and the mix of urban and
                                natural landscapes is just amazing. I think you can see the image in the little
                                tumbnails above, but I think its worth seeing it a little larger, so, if you are looking

                            <p>There's something about renders that fascinates me, creating pieces in general excites
                                me, but when I see the renders come to life... ugh, I think I'm enjoying this way too
                                much! Here are some screenshots of what the radiance calculations that Cinema 4D does
                                when you use Global Illumination look like.</p>

                            <p>Speaking of processes, I aligned these pieces using QGIS to process the data, then I made
                                a couple of rasters that I took to Cinema 4D and finally some labels in Adobe
                                Illustrator. Below you have a render halfway through the process.</p>

                            <p>Of all the dozens of versions I've made and the 10 gigabytes of data I've used, there are
                                a couple that I really love because of the patterns they follow. In some cases, the
                                tallest buildings follow specific streets or financial districts, almost all of them
                                have something like that, here there are some versions without land-use, just buildings
                                without anything else.</p>

                            <p>Or these other sets where the water flows over the city. Cool patterns I think can be
                                accentuated with a little tweak in color.</p>
