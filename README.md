<h1>Hi there!</h1>
Nice to see you here. 
I'm a graphics editor for The New York Times and this is a personal website where I push a mix of personal projects and my portfolio.<br>
There's nothing fancy here, just some javascript and json files along with a bunch of images. If you are looking for my <i>Human-friendly</i> website, you should go to <a href="https://mhinfographics.github.io/">mhinfographics.github.io</a><br>

<h3>Are you looking for something else?</h3>
If you are looking for my obsession with maps, you can visit <a href="https://mhinfographics.github.io/maps">Fun-tography here.</a><br> 
I also run a blog about graphics with a simmilar domain, I know it's confusing, sorry... If that’s the case you might be looking for <a href="https://mhinfographics.com/">mhinfographics.com</a>, that’s the place to go if you are looking for tutorials, <i>infofails</i>, or backstage stories related to my work.

<h3>Are you into arts?</h3>
I run a weekly blog to hang doodles, if you have an open mind and don’t mind silly jokes, you should visit my <a href="https://sundaysketchbook.art/">Sunday Sketchbook.</a> <br> I took a brief pause on this while I finished other projects in the second half of 2025, but I will soon be actively working on it again. Meanwhile there’s a collection of silly stuff I did every Sunday for more than years in a row.
